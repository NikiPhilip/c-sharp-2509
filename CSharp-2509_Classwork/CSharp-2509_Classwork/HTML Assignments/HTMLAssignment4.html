            Kerala (English: /ˈkɛrələ/ ⓘ/ KERR-ə-lə), called Keralam in <br />
            Malayalam (Malayalam: [keːɾɐɭɐm] ⓘ), is a state on the Malabar Coast of  <br />
            India.[15] It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of <br />
            the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions <br />
            of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. <br />
           
            <br />
            <br />
            With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census,  <br />
            Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. <br />
            It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. <br />
            Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official <br />
            language of the state.[19]

                The food in Kerala is simply amazing! <br />
                The combination of coconut, spices, and fresh seafood in every dish is unforgettable.<br />
                Sadya meals and the famous Kerala parotta are a must-try!"
